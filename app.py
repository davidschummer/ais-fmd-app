# PEBBLE CONSOLIDATION: sixteen entries -> eleven. Seven primary pages sit in
# the top pill bar; four admin pages sit under "More". Merged pages are hubs
# (views/*Hub.py) that run the original, unchanged view files one at a time:
#
#   Dues          = Dues + Roster
#   Transactions  = Transactions + Review Queue
#   Assistant     = Assistant + Runbook (as "Help")
#   Alerts & Data Quality = Alerts & Reports + Data Quality
#   Settings      = Audit Log (+ Officer Access, deferred)
#
# MVP SCOPE. Two pages are commented out rather than deleted. In both cases the
# page, its domain module, its tests and its SQLite tables all still exist and
# still pass, and the Postgres side is written and waiting in
# migrations/002_deferred_features.sql. Turning either back on means
# uncommenting one line and running that migration.
#
#   Reimbursements  -- deferred from the start.
#
#   Officer Access  -- deferred 2026-09-08, for the first production term.
#     This is the VP portal's admin page: it maps an email to a role and a
#     committee, which is what Google sign-in looks up in `profiles`. The first
#     term is treasurer-only, so nothing needs those mappings yet -- and leaving
#     the page on would have shipped a feature whose table lives in a migration
#     marked "do not run". It is commented out inside views/SettingsHub.py.
#
#     Note this does NOT disable Google sign-in itself: `auth.login_gate` still
#     offers it whenever an `[auth]` section is configured, and is inert
#     otherwise. It only removes the page for managing who gets in that way.
#
# `Officer.py` ("My Committee") is deliberately a primary page -- it is a
# read-only committee view that a treasurer outranks, and it stays available.
