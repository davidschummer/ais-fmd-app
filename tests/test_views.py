"""
Headless execution tests for every view (P1 from the handoff).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `test_ui_conventions.py` parses the views as text and
never runs them, so 3,148 lines of view code had zero execution coverage.
Every runtime bug in the rebuild was found by hand in a browser: a
`NaN.strip()` crash, currency rendering as LaTeX on three separate pages, a
Plotly `title=None` printing "undefined", pages defaulting to an empty term.
All of those are exceptions or bad output on first render -- exactly what an
`AppTest` run catches.

Three scenarios per view, because the bugs found by hand clustered in two of
them that a happy-path test would miss:

  * populated database -- the normal case
  * empty database     -- no terms, no transactions; where "defaults to an
                          empty term" and "iloc[0] on an empty frame" live
  * reduced role       -- the gated pages must decline, not crash

`AppTest` runs the script exactly as `st.Page` does, so absolute-import and
`st.stop()` behaviour is exercised for real rather than approximated.
